# JointTrainingRC
A Joint Training framework for learning more distinguishable relation features in Relation ClassiÔ¨Åcation
## Description
1. Create a pretrained_model directory and download the corresponding pretrained weights
2. Create a new outputs/best_checkpoint directory to save breakpoints
3. Because the experiment uses contrastive learning, the dataset needs to be processed into the format of comparative learning, and it can be decompressed in the datasets directory
4. Execute train.py
